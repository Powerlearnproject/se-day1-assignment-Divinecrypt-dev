Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is a process that involves writing of codes that can be process by computers to build and design functional websites and applications for real-life usage
Software engineering is pivotal to the technological industry as softwares allows promotes easy communication,commerce and supprots with tasks involving data gathering and dissemination

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
From notes, on of the key milestones in software engineering was the development of programming languages such as FOTRAN. Another key milstone was the development of web applications like facebook which revolutionalized commmunication. Lastly a huge milestone in software engineering was the inregration of Embedded systems such as IoT Devices

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-Which basically involves data gathering
Design-This involves intricate and detailed design of software architecture and interface
Implemention-Involves writing of codes
Testing- This involves running tests to confirm requirements are met and smooth running of softwares
Deployment-This involves release of software to users
Maintenance-Involves providing support, upgrades and update to ensure bug free software

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
While the Waterfall Methodolgy involves step-wise process of distinct phases, the Agile methodology adopts an iterative process with an incremental approach which is a  function of the flexibility and response to change. The Agile methodolgy will be suitable for fintech related softwares that focuses on the intricacies and meticulousness of the system.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Engineer- Writes the code
QAE- Ensures quality of the software by testing
Project Manager- Oversees the planning till execution of the project

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE- Software suites that provides tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g Visual Studio Code
VCS: Software tools that tracking changes to source code and coordinates work among team members

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Short Deadlines- Pressure to deliver softwares on schedule can result in inadequate development and compromised quality.
Solution- The best solution would be to understand software requirements and complexties then creating a timetable based on analysis to ensure deadlines met and quality is assured

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing-Testing individual components or modules of software. Pays attention to details within the software development
Integration Testing-Testing interactions between different components or subsystems. Ensures smooth trsnsitioning
System Testing-Testing the entire software system as a whole. Ensure bug free software
Acceptance Testing-Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. Ensures user friendliness and understanding

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering involves crafting statements or questions that are  clear, detailed and concise to get the best responses for AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Prompt-Picture of a dog sleeping
Improved Prompt- Picture of a German Sheperd dog sleeping on the Couch
